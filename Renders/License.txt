Most Videos in here are Rendered wit Blender and are MIT License, Free to use
Some Videos use effects from Video Maker on Android - labeled Video.Guru on most if not all,
  I am not sure they can be MIT license as the effects might be closer to propriatary thought I am not a lawyer
NeutronStarWithVideoEffects is one of the ones with effects thus might not be able to fall under MIT license
