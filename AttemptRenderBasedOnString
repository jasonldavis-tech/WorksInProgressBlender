Attempting to Render based on a String

S - Sphere
C - Cube
N - Cone
I - Icosphere

Blender sometimes seems to be edited remotely hacked sometimes seems to freeze up in certain cases like typing into Geometry Nodes

Software Developers that work hard do not always get Encouraged and Rewarded sufficiently for their time and investments
